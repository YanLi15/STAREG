Description: This package implements a scalable and tuning parameter-free FDR control procedure for replicability analysis of large-scale multiple testing from SVG detection studies. The procedure takes the joint local FDR based on replicability null hypothesis as the test statistic and develops a robust EM algorithm to estimate the test statistic.
